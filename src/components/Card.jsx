            remember,
            the PC and X-box are my favorite gaming consoles (Dezmondo7 is my gamer tag). For the past 5 years I
            have worked in IT helping some of the worlds largest brands complete some pretty cool projects by
            supplying them highly experienced contractors. I find enjoyment in picking up new technologies and
            building cool projects. Aside from my IT interests I am a bit of a sports fanatic. My passions
            include F1, football, golf, boxing & UFC. Keeping fit and goinig to the gym is important to me
            aswell as trying to eat a balanced diet! Like many I enjoy eating out with friends, watching films
            and documentaries.</p>
